Welcome to  my workshop, where I try to build new AI algorithms often times inspired by neuroscience. This website is for you to see what the process of a jounior researcher is like and hopefully take away some useful intuitions and ideas.

Who am I? I am a master student in AI at the university of Amsterdam. I have previously done research in neuroscience during my undergradute studies. I am aming to become a leading researcher at the intersection of AI and neuroscience with a strong emphesis of creating as much good for the world as I possibly can.

This is also the place where I try to organize my knowledge and intuitions in a way that is most useful for me to come up with new ideas for algorithms or AI architectures. If you have ever tried to wrap your head around what intelligence actually is and how it works, here you can see my attempt at it.
